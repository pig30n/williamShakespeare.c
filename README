              make hamlet enter act3 scene1

The program is a homage on William Shakespeares tragedy Hamlet. When
Hamlet enters the stage in act 3 scene 1 he starts with the opening line

              To be, or not to be, that is the question:
              Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
              The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,
              Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
              And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep'

So basically he asks himself if its better to struggle with life or end it all and die.
But Hamlet doesnt know if its better to die, since nobody knows what comes after death.
In analogy the program asks the question and returns the result. We see that the
condition "to be or not to be" is a tautology and always returns true.

              return 0x2B || !0x2B ? 0x00: 0x01;

So when we execute the build and run process with

              make hamlet enter act3 scene1

we invoke the c compiler to compile "williamShakespeare.c" into the executable "hamlet"
and run the program. The output this process produces should be something like this.

              [enter hamlet]
              The answer to this question is 0

There we have it. Our long-awaited answer to the question: to be or not to be? But what
happened with the executable hamlet? Its gone!

A way to interpret it. Hamlet had no choice but return 0x00. What we didnt know at this
time is, that when hamlet returns 0x00 the makefile removes hamlet. Hence he is dead
and gone. If hamlet would have returned something else, the make process would have stoped
with an error message. But at least we know that hamlet is gone with an EXIT_SUCCESS.
